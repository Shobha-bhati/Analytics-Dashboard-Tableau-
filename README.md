# HR Analytics Dashboard (Tableau)

## Overview

This project presents an interactive HR Analytics Dashboard developed in Tableau to uncover key insights related to employee attrition, demographics, and job satisfaction. The dashboard helps HR teams and decision-makers monitor workforce trends and support data-driven strategies for retention and engagement.

## Tools & Technologies

The dataset was prepared using Microsoft Excel and visualized in Tableau. Data cleaning, structuring, and calculated fields were applied to design a dashboard that is both informative and easy to navigate.

## Features

The dashboard tracks metrics such as total employees, attrition rate, average age, and active headcount. Users can explore trends by department, age group, gender, education, and job role. Interactive filters make it easy to isolate specific segments for focused analysis.

## Insights

Key findings include high attrition in the Sales and R&D departments, a dominant age group between 30â€“36 years, and higher attrition among male employees and those with life sciences backgrounds. Interestingly, even roles with high job satisfaction, like Sales Executive, showed notable attrition, pointing to deeper organizational challenges.

## Skills Demonstrated

The project demonstrates capabilities in data visualization, Tableau dashboard design, Excel-based data cleaning, and business analysis. It reflects an ability to convert raw HR data into strategic insight.

## Conclusion

The HR Analytics Dashboard provides a comprehensive view of workforce behavior, empowering HR teams to take informed actions to reduce turnover and improve employee engagement through clear, data-driven insights.
